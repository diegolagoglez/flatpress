FlatPress is a really, really simple CMS.

CMS are a very complex piece of software today. They have a database, a template system, a big and great backend… but all that stuff overload the server for a really simple sites.

With FlatPress you only have to write the contents of your site with the directory structure you want. After that, run `make` and your site will be generated with the same directory structure, and the server will serve it as static HTML. No database needed or a big backend. Only a text editor.

# Dependencies

FlatPress needs this packages:

* `make` to build the complete site.
* `pandoc` to convert between MarkDown and HTML.
* `git` (optional) to deploy the Makefile.

# Deployment and usage

In order to deploy a site built with FlatPress you have to follow the next steps:

> I am still planning this stuff ;)

* Clone the FlatPress respository: `git clone https://github.com/diegolagoglez/flatpress.git`
* Write the contents in the `private` directory.
* Create the CSS template in the `template` directory.
* Run `make` in the FlatPress root directory.
* Done.
* What else?
